**Why should I use rabbit-client?**

`rabbit-client` provides a high level abstraction to consume and produce asyncronous events though RabbitMQ 

**What type of job can I use?**

The `Subscribe` class needed of a `job` that nothing more is that a callable. This will be executed when a event is received by queue. The response output will follow:  
1. there's a `publish` configured? If true the response will be sent to destination exchange.  
2. there's a `db` connection configured? If true the response will be stored.  
3. If the previous parameters are false then the output will be sent to callable configured.
